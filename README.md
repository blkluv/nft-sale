Example repo to render and interact with NFT Editions / And well --- any nft on~chain (ETH Mainnet Only).

## About

Much of the code in this repo is the product of the amazing work done accross the teams at [@ourzora](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-co). The mindshare and hard work across teams, from protocol to backend to frontend and product has generated an amazing ecosystem to work with.

The goal of this repo is to expose much of the frontend functionality we have been working on collectively in the context of a fun exploratory project.

Any and all feedback is welcome, as we develop these frontends we aim to lower the barrier to creation.

## Features

- List and Sell Tokens with Zora V3 Asks

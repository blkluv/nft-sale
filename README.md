## About

Much of the code in this repo is the product of the amazing work done accross the teams at [@ourzora](https://github.com/ourzora/zora-co). From protocol to backend to frontend and product this ecosystem is ꪀׁׅꫀׁׅܻ᥊ׁׅtׁׅ ᥣׁׅ֪ꫀׁׅܻ᥎꫶ׁׅꫀׁׅܻᥣׁׅ֪.

The goal of this repo is to expose much of the frontend functionality we have been working on collectively in the context of a fun exploratory project. I'll be adding more features as they come.

Use it as a template, enjoy, have a play.
